Super Meat Boy Multi-Language Loader

For unknown reason, locale of Super Meat Boy is limited in English, German, Russian, Spanish, Polish.
Even worse, you can't select locale if game is non-Steam version (like SMB from Humble Bundle)

With this application, you can choose all of locales from Super Meat Boy.

Supported locales:
Debug*, English, Japanese, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Korean, Chinese, Portuguese,
Chinese-Fontonly**, Russian, Polish.

*: It will print key of text.
**: Seems it loads Chinese fonts but doesn't load texts.

Usage:
Launch exe file with parameter
SuperMeatBoyMultilangLoader.exe --language=Korean --smbpath="SuperMeatBoy.exe"

or create ini file that has same name as exe(SuperMeatBoyMultilangLoader.ini) with this content:

[LoaderOptions]
Language=Korean
SMBPath=SuperMeatBoy.exe

For choosing language, please see Support locales from upper side of this readme.
(note: it's not case-sensitive.)
